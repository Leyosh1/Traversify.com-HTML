        <h1>Las Vegas</h1>
        <h2>Sin City</h2>
        <p class="tab"> Sin City, America's Playground, the Entertainment Capital of the World ... all worthy names for this Nevada hot spot. Think of Vegas as a theme park rather than a city – it can awe as much as it can overwhelm, and that's part of the appeal. This is a city where inhibitions are not welcome: Every night, Las Vegas draws pleasure mongers to the brightly lit Strip like moths to a flame. While you may not want to go as far as to reenact "The Hangover," you certainly don't want to leave without experiencing a bit of "Viva Las Vegas."
        Today, Las Vegas can provide any kind of vacation you can imagine. You can opt for the traditional high-roller getaway complete with all-nighters at the blackjack table or TAO Nightclub. Or you can make it all about luxury with visits to hotel spas, high-end boutiques and gourmet restaurants. Las Vegas is also a great jumping-off point for outdoor activities, such as ATV tours, hiking in Red Rock Canyon or visiting the Hoover Dam via a helicopter tour or a bus tour. You can even bring the kids along: Underage travelers will get a kick out of a Cirque du Soleil performance, the Bellagio Fountain show and the Neon Museum.</p>
