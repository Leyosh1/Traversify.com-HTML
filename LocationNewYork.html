        <p class="tab">The best way to get around New York City is on foot as traffic is fairly heavy around-the-clock. That said, the subway system is a convenient option, too, and it extends throughout Manhattan and into the other New York boroughs. Buses are another affordable way to get around, but keep in mind they traverse streets clogged with weaving cars and cabs. Picking up a car isn't the best mode of transportation, as traffic is heavy. To get from the two main airports – LaGuardia (LGA) and John F. Kennedy International (JFK) – into the city, you'll likely want to take a taxi or ride-hailing service like Lyft or Uber. If you'd like to mix in a little sightseeing with your transportation, consider a bus tour or a boat tour.

Many East Coast travelers tend to arrive in New York City on one of the bus services like BoltBus or Megabus. Amtrak is another popular way of getting into the city and trains roll into Penn Station daily..
